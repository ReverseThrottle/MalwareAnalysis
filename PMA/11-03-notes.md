Lab.dll

exports odd function "zzz69806582"

Opens mutex "MZ" otherwise will create a new mutex "MZ"

Create fill %SYSTEMROOT%\\kernel64x.dll

Calls SetFilePointer to change the file pointer location 

We138 then call sub 10000
	and then call sub 10001030
	doing some kind of change on char_cpy_ which I think will be a string 

	then call sub 10001000

	which calls -> GetForegroundWindow which retrieves a handle to the foreground window

	then calls GetWindowTextA which copies the name of the title window into buffer


Lab11-03.exe

main
	copies Lab11-03.dll to inet_epar32.dll and then creates a new file cisvc.exe within sys32

	it then creates a filemapping by calling CreateFileMappingA as well as MappViewOfFile
